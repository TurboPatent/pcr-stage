<p>Polymerase Chain Reaction-(PCR) is a process by which a biological sample that contains a target DNA moleculte segment&nbsp;is added to a reaction volume that includes primers, free nucleotides (dNTPs), and polymerase (typically Taq). The reaction cycles the temperature of the PCR mixture to generate copies of the target sequence exponentially. Components of a typical PCR reaction are the DNA template (the sample DNA that contains the target sequence to amplify), deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to build the replicas of the template,&nbsp;PCR buffer, primers (forward and reverse), and&nbsp;Taq polymerase.</p>
<p>PCR&nbsp;is an efficient and cost-effective molecular tool to copy or amplify small segments of DNA or RNA.&nbsp; PCR combines the principles of complementary nucleic acid hybridization with those of nucleic acid replication applied repeatedly in cycles. It results in the exponential&nbsp;production of the specific target DNA/RNA sequences within a relatively short period.</p>
<p>PCR is an in vitro amplification technique that can amplify a single copy of nucleic acid target by using two synthetic oligonucleotide &ldquo;primers&rdquo; that bind to the target genomic sequence, which are extended by a&nbsp; Taq polymerase (a thermostable DNA polymerase) . An automated process of repeated cycles (usually 25 to 40) of&nbsp; denaturation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; template DNA (at 94&deg;C), annealing of primers to&nbsp; their&nbsp; complementary sequences&nbsp; (50&deg;C), and primer extension (70&deg;C) &nbsp;is employed for the amplification of target sequence.</p>
<p>PCR is useful in many applications, including identification and characterization of infectious agents in patient samples, identification of microorganisms grown in culture, detection of antimicrobial resistance, investigation of pathogen strains, genetic fingerprinting (e.g., forensic application/paternity testing), detection of mutations (e.g., investigation of genetic diseases), cloning, and sequencing.&nbsp;</p>
