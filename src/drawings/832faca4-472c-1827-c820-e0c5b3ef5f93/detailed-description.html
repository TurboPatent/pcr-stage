Denaturation is the process of separating the two hydrogen-bonded complementary chains of DNA into a pair of single stranded polynucleotide molecules by a process of heating (e.g., to 94°C to 96°C).&nbsp;Annealing (primer binding) involves lowering the temperature of the mixture (e.g., to 45-60 °C) so that the primers can attach themselves to target regions of the&nbsp;single-stranded DNA strands. The primers are&nbsp;oligonucleotides selected to bind to the target regions specifically.&nbsp;Extension is the process of growing new DNA strands using the polymerase as a catalyst for incorporating sequences of the dNTPs onto the attached primers. The newly formed double strands around the target region are then denatured and the cycle is repeated.

<p>The primers may include probes.&nbsp;A probe comprises a molecule (referred to as a reporter molecule) that gives off a signal under certain conditions.&nbsp;Probes are usually primers with an additional group comprising the reporter molecule.&nbsp; This reporter molecule can be a molecule that fluoresces and shines when hit with light, or it can be an attachment to a colored bead, or it can emit radiation, for example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The signal given off by a probe&nbsp;can be used to detect the PCR-amplified products, which are referred to as amplicons. Based on the nature of the reporter molecule used, the probe generates radioactive, colorimetric, fluorometric, or chemiluminescent signals. Probes are useful to enable&nbsp;visualization of the PCR products and to provide&nbsp;specificity by ensuring that the amplicon is the target sequence of interest and not the result of non-specific amplification. In some cases a simple gel electrophoresis (EC) process is&nbsp;sufficient to confirm the&nbsp;presence of specific amplicons.</p>
